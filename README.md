#Instructions

*For District Summary, calculate the total number of unique schools, number of students, total budget,average mean math and reading score, percentage of students who passed math and reading equal or greater to 70 and create high-level snapshot of districts key metircs in a data frame.

*For School Summary, calculate the total student count, total school budget and per capita spending, average math, average reading scores, calculate the number of schools with math and reading scores 70 or higher, calculate the schools that passed both math and reading with scores 70 or higher, calculate the passing rates, and create and a display frame called "per_school_summary".

*For Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing), sort schools by % overall passing, descending order and display the top 5 rows, sort schools by % overall passing, ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

*For Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing),  sort schools by % overall passing, ascending order and display the top 5 rows, sort schools by % overall passing, ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

*For Math Scores, separate data by grade, group by "school_name" and take the mean of each, select only the "math_score", combine each scores inot a single dataframe and display

*For Readying Scores, separate data by grade, group by "school_name" and take the mean of each, select only the "reading_score", combine each scores into a single dataframe and display

*For Scores by School Spending, establish bins, create a copy of the school summary since it has the "Per Student Budget", Categorize spending based on the binds, calculate averages, assemble in dataframe and display.

*For Scores by School Size, estibalish bines, categorize spending based on the bins, use pd.cut on the total sutudents column of the per_school_summary dataframe, average the desir3ed columns, create and display dataframe called size_summary

*For Scores by School Type, group the per_school_summary Datafram by "School Type" and average the results and select new column data, assemble the new data by type into a DataFrame called 'type_summary'.

*Add written descrioption of at leaset two observable trends based on the data.
